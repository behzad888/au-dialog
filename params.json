Ensure that [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) is installed. This provides the platform on which the build tooling runs.\r\n2. From the project folder, execute the following command:\r\n\r\n  ```shell\r\n  npm install\r\n  ```\r\n3. Ensure that [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) is installed. If you need to install it, use the following command:\r\n\r\n  ```shell\r\n  npm install -g gulp\r\n  ```\r\n4. Ensure that [jspm](http://jspm.io/) is installed. If you need to install it, use the following command:\r\n\r\n  ```shell\r\n  npm install -g jspm\r\n  ```\r\n  > **Note:** jspm queries GitHub to install semver packages, but GitHub has a rate limit on anonymous API requests. It is advised that you configure jspm with your GitHub credentials in order to avoid problems. You can do this by executing `jspm registry config github` and following the prompts.\r\n5. Install the client-side dependencies with jspm:\r\n\r\n  ```shell\r\n  jspm install -y\r\n  ```\r\n  >**Note:** Windows users, if you experience an error of \"unknown command unzip\" you can solve this problem by doing `npm install -g unzip` and then re-running `jspm install`.\r\n6. To run the app, execute the following command:\r\n\r\n  ```shell\r\n  gulp watch\r\n  ```\r\n7. Browse to [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000) to see the app. You can make changes in the code found under `src` and the browser should auto-refresh itself as you save files.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
